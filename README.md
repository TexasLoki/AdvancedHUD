AdvancedHUD
===========

A continuation of AdvancedHUD by TurboSlow.

Since TurboSlow has given up development on AdvancedHUD, I figured "well shit, I do HUD mods too, so why not pick that up?" So I am in the process of picking it up. I have most elements working as they were in previous versions and I am hoping to use some of the features in this to finally get movable HUD elements into TukMC.

In case anyone is wondering where TurboSlow had announced it:
